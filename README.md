# wave-threaded-server
A wave-shaped concurrency controller for Express.js using worker threads and adaptive back-pressure.  This single-file module runs an Express server with dynamic, load-aware concurrency using a "wave" model that adjusts threading and queue handling based on system load and response latency.
